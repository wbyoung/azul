   * {@link HasMany}) when we cannot rely on the inverse relationship being

   * conflicts.
   * @param {Relation} relation The relation to join.
   * @param {Object} [options]
   * @param {Boolean} [options.reverse] Do the reverse of a standard join.
   * @param {String} [options.through] The relation name that this is being
   * joined through. Note that this must match the name that was given to this
