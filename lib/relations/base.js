   * instance:
   *
   *     var hasMany = HasMany.attr();
   *
   * The returned function essentially binds the creation of a
   * {@link RelationAttr}, locking in the class on which it's being called as
   * the type to use for the relation attribute. When you call the returned
   * function, the given arguments are used as the arguments for the relation
   * attribute.
   *
   * The above example code defines the `hasMany` function, which has the
   * `HasMany` relation locked in as the type. When `hasMany` is called, for
   * instance `hasMany(options)`, the arguments that are given to that function
   * will be passed to the {@link RelationAttr} constructor as the `args`.
   * These will eventually be given as additional arguments to the relation's
   * constructor, in this case `HasMany` would receive options as an argument.
   * If used in the context of a `User` having many `articles`, the exact
   * arguments to the `HasMany` constructor would be
   * `['articles', User, options]`. See {@link RelationAttr} for more details.
