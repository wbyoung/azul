 * @class Manager
 * @extends Property

 *
 * The object manager for models.
 *
 * Managers allow you to pre-configure queries for collections of objects that
 * are frequently accessed. You can define new collections on your model and
 * also have the ability to override the default `objects` collection.
 *
 * For example, setting up custom managers to allow quick access to
 * `Person.men` and `Person.women` would be done like so:
 *
 *     var FemaleManager = Manager.extend({
 *       query: function() {
 *         return this._super().where({ sex: 'female' });
 *       }
 *     });
 *
 *     var MaleManager = Manager.extend({
 *       query: function() {
 *         return this._super().where({ sex: 'male' });
 *       }
 *     });
 *
 *     var Person = Model.extend({}, {
 *       women: FemaleManager.create(),
 *       men: MaleManager.create(),
 *       objects: Manager.create() // could customize...
 *     });
